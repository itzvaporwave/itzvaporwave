### Hey there ^w^

### Welcome to my GitHub, filled with old code and half completed passion projects. If your here to learn or use my code for something important your in the wrong place.
### I love to tinker with old hardware, and consequently the majority of repos here are to fix stupid stuff. 
### Main languages are: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP.
### My pronouns are she/her/hers, and you can contact me on twitter @Itzlizzieee.

## TLDR: Stupid programming girl, probably working on getting some old computer to live again like some witch doctor. ^^
