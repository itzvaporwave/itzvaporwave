#    Hai there! ðŸ’–

* ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub, filled with old code and half completed passion projects. 
* ðŸŒ¸ If you're here to learn or use my code for something important, you're probably in the wrong place.
* ðŸ”§ I love to tinker with old hardware, and consequently the majority of repos here are to fix stupid stuff. 
* ðŸ’» Main languages are: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP.
* ðŸŒˆ My pronouns are she/her/hers, and i'm gay as fuck.
* ðŸ“¬ Contact me on Discord: Vaporwave#1000 or Twitter: [@ItzLizzieee](https://twitter.com/ItzLizzieee)

#### ðŸ’¬ TLDR: Stupid programming girl, probably working on getting some old computer to live again like some witch doctor. ^^
